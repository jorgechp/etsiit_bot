# How can I contribute

## Filling bug reports / enhacements proposals

For creating new issues you might go to [the issue tab
](https://github.com/jorgechp/etsiit_bot/issues) and select one of the
templates, whether you want to fill a bug report or propose a new enhancement
for the code base of the project.

## Proposing new code changes throughout pull requests

With a **previous** creation of the issue (**if it does not exist**) you may
want to solve a problem or introduce a new feature (approved by the manteiners)
, so you can follow the [github fork guide
](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) and create a pull request
from the pull request tab.
